Sure! I’ll walk you through **Hugging Face Transformers in Python** step by step — starting from the basics and moving upward. I’ll keep it practical with runnable code examples.

---

## ✅ 1. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

If you're using Apple Silicon (M1/M2), you might use:

```bash
pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
```

---

## ✅ 2. Your First Transformer: Text Generation (GPT-style)

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator("Once upon a time", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)

print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```

This will generate text based on your input prompt.

---

## ✅ 3. Sentiment Analysis Example

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("I love learning AI with Transformers!")
print(result)
```

Output example:

```python
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.99}]
```

---

## ✅ 4. Use a Specific Model and Tokenizer

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

inputs = tokenizer("Hugging Face Transformers are powerful!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class = torch.argmax(logits).item()
print(predicted_class)
```

`0 = negative`, `1 = positive` for this model.

---

## ✅ 5. Zero-Shot Classification (No Training Needed)

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")

result = classifier(
    "I want to invest in blockchain and AI technology.",
    candidate_labels=["finance", "sports", "technology", "politics"]
)

print(result)
```

---

## ✅ 6. Fill-in-the-Blank (Masked Language Model)

```python
from transformers import pipeline

unmasker = pipeline("fill-mask", model="bert-base-uncased")
result = unmasker("AI is going to [MASK] the world.")
print(result)
```

---

## ✅ 7. Download a Model Locally

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

inputs = tokenizer("Hello from Hugging Face!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
```

---

## ✅ 8. What Do You Want Next?

Pick what you want to learn next:

1. ✅ Fine-tuning a model
2. ✅ Using Transformers for translation
3. ✅ Using Transformers for Q&A (question answering)
4. ✅ Train your own tokenizer
5. ✅ Build your own chatbot

Just tell me the number (or topic), and I’ll continue from there!
